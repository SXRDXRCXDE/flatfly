    "aboutText1": "It all started with frustration from searching for housing on Facebook. Endless scrolling in groups, outdated listings and zero certainty about who you'll actually be living with. We told ourselves it had to be better. We wanted to create a place that wouldn't just be a bulletin board with listings, but a space that truly connects people who click.",
    "aboutText2": "Our idea got real shape thanks to cooperation with the Innovation Center of Ústí Region (ICUK). Within the business incubator, we were able to turn our vision into a functional platform. We fine-tuned features, tested beta versions and focused on what's missing elsewhere – simplicity and trust.\n\nToday FlatFly is a ready project that helps not only students, but everyone looking for a new start. Whether you're moving for work, school, or starting a new life chapter, we want finding a home to be safe and stress-free for you."
